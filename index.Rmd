## About me

I am an undergraduate student of Genomic Sciences program at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. My current research interests lean towards developmental biology, transcriptomics and ML. I am currently focusing on the identification of complex phenotypes caused by mutations in the BAF chromatin remodeling complex in the zebra fish model at Hilda Lomeli's laboratory at IBT-UNAM . Additionally, I am an apprentice and a new member of Leonardo Collado's laboratory at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development
